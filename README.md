AI-Powered Recipe Generator 🍳🤖

Welcome to the AI-Powered Recipe Generator project, which uses advanced AI models to generate detailed recipes from simple text prompts. This project leverages OctoAI and is run on Google Colab for fast and efficient execution.

Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of AI to generate dynamic, personalized recipes based on user-provided text prompts. Whether it's a specific dish, a cuisine, or even a creative combination of ingredients, the AI model processes the input and generates a fully detailed recipe, including ingredients, instructions, and more.

Key Features
Generate custom recipes from a text prompt.
Powered by OctoAI for efficient and high-quality AI-driven outputs.
Run on Google Colab for free and fast processing.
Supports detailed cooking instructions, ingredients, and preparation methods.

How It Works :
Text Input: Provide a prompt (e.g., "A vegan pasta dish with mushrooms and spinach").
AI Processing: The model processes the prompt using OctoAI and generates a recipe.
Output: A full recipe is displayed with ingredients and step-by-step instructions.
